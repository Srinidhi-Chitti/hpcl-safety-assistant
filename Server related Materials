## 1. Introduction to Servers
Servers are powerful computers or software systems that provide services, data, or resources to other computers (called clients) over a network. They handle tasks like hosting websites, storing files, running applications, or managing databases.

A **server** is a real, tangible hardware machine designed to run server software and provide services to clients. It includes components like a processor, RAM, storage, and network interfaces—just like a regular computer—but is usually more powerful and built for continuous, heavy-duty operation.

### Key Features of a Physical Server
- **Dedicated Hardware:** Not shared with other systems.
- **High Performance:** Supports large workloads and multiple users.
- **Used For:**
  - Hosting websites
  - Managing databases
  - Running enterprise applications
  - Virtualization (hosting multiple VMs)

## 2. Pros and Cons of Servers

### Advantages
- **Centralized Management** – Easier updates, security, and control.
- **High Availability** – Designed for 24/7 uptime (RAID, redundant power, failover).
- **Scalability** – CPU, RAM, and storage can be expanded.
- **Security** – Centralized policies and controlled access.
- **Resource Sharing** – Shared access to files, printers, internet.
- **Backup & Recovery** – Supports automated disaster recovery.

### Disadvantages
- **High Cost** – Expensive purchase and maintenance.
- **Complex Setup** – Needs technical expertise.
- **Hardware Dependency** – Downtime if physical hardware fails.
- **Security Risks** – Targets for cyberattacks; needs constant patching.
- **Limited Mobility** – Stationary and less flexible than cloud.

## 3. Server vs Other Systems
| Feature             | Server | Desktop | Laptop | Cloud | Virtual Machine |
|--------------------|--------|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Purpose            | Multi-client services | Personal use | Portable personal | Hosted remotely | Runs on a hypervisor |
| Hardware           | ECC RAM, RAID, redundancy | Standard | Battery powered | Data center-based | Uses host resources |
| Mobility           | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Reliability        | High | Low | Low | High | Depends on host |
